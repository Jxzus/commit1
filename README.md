I should make a menu that asks to add students, and modify them in c++. But I have some errors in the code, when I want to modify a student, it could be the name or the major, it is not modified as it should be in the.txt file. 
I still need to continue giving functions to the parts of the menu, but I am stuck on the error in the .txt file.
